                Hey there!

                Thanks for dropping by my website/portfolio.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I'm an aspiring Web Developer with a passion for tech and creativity. While my main focus lies in crafting engaging and user-friendly websites, I also occasionally dabble in Game Development using Unity and explore various facets of Graphic Design on the side.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Just five months ago, I embarked on my coding journey. Growing up, my exposure to technology was limited to gaming consoles. However, since acquiring my first laptop last year and now having a custom-built PC, I've been able to explore new paths in tech. Coding, once distant and complex, has become an exciting reality.
                
                <br><br>
                
                In addition to my full-time job, I dedicate over 20 hours per week to honing my web development skills. I'm committed to becoming an active member of the tech community and have recently started contributing on GitHub. Looking ahead, I'm also interested in venturing into application development to broaden my skill set and create even more impactful digital experiences.
                
                <br><br>
                
                On a personal note, I'm 24 and based in London. Previously living in North Yorkshire, where technology felt like outcast magic, I actively participated in MMA. I thrive both in independent projects and collaborative environments. While I used to immerse myself in gaming, I've shifted my focus towards creating websites and digital experiences. Building websites for others brings me immense pride and satisfaction.
                
                <br><br>
                
                I'm excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts, collaborate on exciting projects, and continue growing in the ever-evolving world of web and application development.
