Hallo!

      Thanks for checking out my Website's Repository.
      Just a way of storing the code at various stage and to showcase my ability.
      As of 10/04/2024, I'll have been coding for 5 months.

Thanks again for stopping by!

Website went live 2.2

Discovered how to use Git in console. To commit etc to repositories and such. Found I don't have to create folders for each save, I can use Git to push-commit.
